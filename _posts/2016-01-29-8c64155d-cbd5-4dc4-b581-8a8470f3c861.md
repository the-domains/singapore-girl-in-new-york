I missed writing, in general.

Work life really hasn't been bad but it has, for some reason, sapped me of my energy - both physical and mental. Mostly, all I've wanted to do when I'm home is lie down.

That has to change. I'm just a little upset that the change didn't come from within, and from a kick in the form of an email.
